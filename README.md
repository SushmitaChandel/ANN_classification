# ANN_classification
Classification using artificial neural network

The file "ANN_classification.ipynb" can be used to perform binary classification using Artificial neural networks.

This somewhat follows the <a href='https://docs.fast.ai/tabular.models.html'>fast.ai library</a>. The goal is to define a model based on the number of continuous columns plus the number of categorical columns and their embeddings. 

It is the solution of the excercise in the course "pytorch for deep learning with python bootcamp" on udemy.

The *.yml contains all the dependencies.
